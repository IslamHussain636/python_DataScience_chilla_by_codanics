# What is Data Science?
Data science is a field of applied mathematics and statistics that provides useful information based on large amounts of complex data or big data.
Data science, or data-driven science, combines aspects of different fields with the aid of computation to interpret reams of data for decision-making purposes.
> KEY TAKEAWAYS

> Data science uses techniques such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to extract meaningful information and to predict future patterns and behaviors.
Advances in technology, the internet, social media, and the use of technology have all increased access to big data.
The field of data science is growing as technology advances and big data collection and analysis techniques become more sophisticated.

- Understanding Data Science
  
 Data is drawn from different sectors, channels, and platforms, including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, healthcare surveys, and internet searches. 
 The increase in the amount of data available opened the door to a new field of study based on big data—the massive data sets that contribute to the creation of better
 operational tools in all sectors. 

The continually increasing access to data is possible due to advancements in technology and collection techniques. Individuals buying patterns and behavior can 
be monitored and predictions
made based on the information gathered.

However, the ever-increasing data is unstructured and requires parsing for effective decision-making. This process is complex and time-consuming for companies—hence, 
the emergence of data science.
- A Brief History of Data Science
  
The term "data science" has been in use since the early 1960s, when it was used synonymously with "computer science".1 Later, the term was made distinct to
define the survey of data processing methods used in a range of different applications.
In 2001 William S. Cleveland used for the first time the term "data science" to refer to an independent discipline.3 The Harvard Business Review published
an article in 2012 describing the role of the data scientist as the “sexiest job of the 21st century.
## How Data Science Is Applied
  
Data science incorporates tools from multiple disciplines to gather a data set, process, and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, 
and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, 
and programming.

Data mining applies algorithms to the complex data set to reveal patterns that are then used to extract useful and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures or
predictive analytics use this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past.

Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning
perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at a predicted time.

Using analytics, the data analyst collects and processes the structured data from the machine learning stage using algorithms. The analyst interprets, converts, 
and summarizes the data into a cohesive language that the decision-making team can understand. Data science is applied to practically all contexts and, as the
data scientist's role evolves, the field will expand to encompass data architecture, data engineering, and data administration.

## Data Scientist
  
A data scientist collects, analyzes, and interprets large volumes of data, in many cases, to improve a company's operations. Data scientist professionals develop
statistical models that analyze data and detect patterns, trends, and relationships in data sets. This information can be used to predict consumer behavior or
to identify business and operational risks.

The data scientist role is often that of a storyteller presenting data insights to decision-makers in a way that is understandable and applicable to problem-solving.
